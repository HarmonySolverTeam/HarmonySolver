init.py was preapred in order to made it possible to run/test classes written in js compatible with qml

Its main goal it to traslate imports, add exports for all the functions in file with declaration stats with keyword "function" with no
white characters befere it (line have to start with "function"), and also export all variable marked as "//G" f.e. : 

//G
var majorScalePitches = [1, 2, 3, 4]

It is simple concept, could not working properly at all.
